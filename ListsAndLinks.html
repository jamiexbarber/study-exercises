        <h2>Can I share with you?</h2>
        <p>A secret, that contains a love of mine? Namely, deeply personal and introspective writing
            that leaves me feeling less alone, and more human and alive. Connected. Happy to be on Earth,
            in communion with others who have felt what I've felt and found a way to bring those feelings
            to the light, kindly and withouth guilt or shame. Only understanding. Let me share two examples.

                <ul>
                    <li>To be real, this one is very sad. It's hard to like it as much, but she's honest</li>
