        <h1>Welcome to Jamie's First Webpage!</h1>
        <h2>I don't even know what I want to say</h2>
        <h3>I just know there is something inside that needs an outlet</h3>
        <h4>It may not matter.</h4>
        <h5>How can I get my opinons out into the world?</h5>
        <h6>Can I write something people will actually want to engage with?</h6>
        <p>I'm experimenting with this from Visual Studio</p>
        <p>How do I figure this out in a meaningful way. 
            Should I do research on books, should my angle be books?</p>
        <p>Engineering Education?</p>
        <p>Tutoring Help?</p>
        <p>Book Reviews?</p>
        <p>I need a place to record everything I'm learning.
            I can bolden text, I can make it italics.
            <br />I can do subscripts and I can do superscripts.
            <br />I can add break tags (in the middle of paragraphs and I can add)
            <hr />
            And I can do horizontal breaks
            <br />Magic.
            <br /> I can do strong and emphasis notes
            <br /> <blockquote>I can make blockquotes, note that quote effects 
                be achieved with CSS. Only use for actual quotes
            </blockquote>
            I can make anything a <q>small quote</q> as well.
            <br /> I can abbreviate, I can define, I can make a citation.
            <br />I can specify an address or insert/delete content in addition to 
            <s>stricking through words</s>
